# EXERION

This was my first foray into FPGA programming and has proven to be a very rewarding process.  Porting the core to the pocket has been another learning experience and it proves that I still have a lot to learn.

Thank you to Boogermann for providing the OpenGateware core template.

<h2>Game Overview</h2>
Exerion is a vertical oriented (TATE) shoot 'em up game that utilizes a 8 way movement and two types of weaponry. The game features impressive (for the time) parallax scrolling effects in the background layer and inertia applied to the ship's movement.

The player's ship is armed with a 'single shot' and 'rapid fire'.  Rapid fire is limited by the 'CHARGE' count shown at the bottom left of the screen and builds up by destroying enemies with the single shot.  If you do not miss any enemies within a wave, a bonus score will be displayed and multiplies with further accurate shots.
